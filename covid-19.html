    Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
    Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover
    without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular
    disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
    The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it
    causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol
    based rub frequently and not touching your face.

    A novel coronavirus (CoV) is a new strain of coronavirus.
    The disease caused by the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, has been named coronavirus disease
    2019 (COVID-19) – ‘CO’ stands for corona, ‘VI’ for virus, and ‘D’ for disease.
    Formerly, this disease was referred to as ‘2019 novel coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV.’
    The COVID-19 virus is a new virus linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
    and some types of common cold.
    <br>

    Millions of enterprises face an existential threat. Nearly half of the world’s 3.3 billion global workforce are at
    risk of losing their livelihoods. Informal economy workers are particularly vulnerable because the majority lack
    social protection and access to quality health care and have lost access to productive assets. Without the means to
    earn an income during lockdowns, many are unable to feed themselves and their families. For most, no income means no
    food, or, at best, less food and less nutritious food.
    <br>
    <br>
    The pandemic has been affecting the entire food system and has laid bare its fragility. Border closures, trade
    restrictions and confinement measures have been preventing farmers from accessing markets, including for buying
    inputs and selling their produce, and agricultural workers from harvesting crops, thus disrupting domestic and
    international food supply chains and reducing access to healthy, safe and diverse diets. The pandemic has decimated
    jobs and placed millions of livelihoods at risk. As breadwinners lose jobs, fall ill and die, the food security and
    nutrition of millions of women and men are under threat, with those in low-income countries, particularly the most
    marginalized populations, which include small-scale farmers and indigenous peoples, being hardest hit.
    <br>
    <br>
    Symptoms of covid 19 can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can cause
    pneumonia or
    breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal.
    These symptoms are similar to the flu (influenza) or the common cold, which are a lot more common than COVID-19.
    This is why testing is required to confirm if someone has COVID-19. It’s important to remember that key prevention
    measures are the same – frequent hand washing, and respiratory hygiene (cover your cough or sneeze with a flexed
    elbow or tissue, then throw away the tissue into a closed bin).
    <br>
    <br>
    In the COVID-19 crisis food security, public health, and employment and labour issues, in particular workers’ health
    and safety, converge. Adhering to workplace safety and health practices and ensuring access to decent work and the
    protection of labour rights in all industries will be crucial in addressing the human dimension of the crisis.
    Immediate and purposeful action to save lives and livelihoods should include extending social protection towards
    universal health coverage and income support for those most affected. These include workers in the informal economy
    and in poorly protected and low-paid jobs, including youth, older workers, and migrants. Particular attention must
    be paid to the situation of women, who are over-represented in low-paid jobs and care roles. Different forms of
    support are key, including cash transfers, child allowances and healthy school meals, shelter and food relief
    initiatives, support for employment retention and recovery, and financial relief for businesses, including micro,
    small and medium-sized enterprises. In designing and implementing such measures it is essential that governments
    work closely with employers and workers.

    COVID-19 is a new virus, and we are still learning about how it affects children and pregnant women. We know people
    of any age can be infected and transmit the virus. However, older people and/or those with pre-existing medical
    conditions seem more likely to develop severe illness. Cold, mild cough, fever, and body pain are the common
    symptoms of infection. We have also noted that other symptoms such as pain in the abdomen, loose motions, and
    vomiting are also present in children.
    Clinical features or symptoms affecting children and adolescents, possibly associated with COVID-19, can include but
    are not limited to: fever, headache, body pain, tiredness, cough, breathlessness, poor feeding, loss of taste or
    smell (in a child more than eight years old), rash, red or pink eyes, swollen and/or red lips, tongue, hands, feet,
    gastrointestinal problems (diarrhoea, vomiting).
    <br>
    <br>
    Now is the time for global solidarity and support, especially with the most vulnerable in our societies,
    particularly in the emerging and developing world. Only together can we overcome the intertwined health and social
    and economic impacts of the pandemic and prevent its escalation into a protracted humanitarian and food security
    catastrophe, with the potential loss of already achieved development gains.
